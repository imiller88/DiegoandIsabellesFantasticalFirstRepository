## This is README for the submission of the First Pair Assignment by Diego and Isabelle
We have created a GitHub repository called **DiegoandIsabellesFantasticalFirstRepository** that will include R source code files that access at least two core R data sets, perform basic transformations on the data, and illustrate the datas' distributions using a variety relevant of descriptive statistics. At least one file will dynamically link to another in a substantively meaningful way. Finally, another pair will make a pull request and it should be discussed and merged.

_Deadline 4 March, 10% of final grade._

For the purposes of this assignment, we will be examining the following core R data sets:

1) nhtemp, a time series of average yearly temperatures in New Haven, CT from 1912 to 1971, and

2) USArrests, statistics on violent crime arrests per 100,000 residents by US state in 1973.

#Notes for R
The package for piping, dyplr, is used and will therefore need to be installed if not already present.

#other files included in repository & description

-nhtemp.R - the R file with the original coding of descriptive statistics relating to nhtemp.

-USArrests.R - the R file with the original coding of descriptive statistics relating to USArrests.

-Citations.bib - a sample .bib file, for testing testing 123.

-Assignment1FinalOutput.rmd - a markdown document pulling together some of the descriptive statistics.

-Assignment1FinalOutput.pdf - the knit PDF with a sample of descriptive statistics.
