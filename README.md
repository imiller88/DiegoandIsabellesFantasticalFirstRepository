#Introduction
This is README for the submission of the First Pair Assignment by Diego and Isabelle. We have created a GitHub repository called **DiegoandIsabellesFantasticalFirstRepository** that will include R source code files that access at least two core R data sets, perform basic transformations on the data, and illustrate the datas' distributions using a variety relevant of descriptive statistics. At least one file will dynamically link to another in a substantively meaningful way. Finally, another pair will make a pull request and it should be discussed and merged. 

_Deadline 4 March, 10% of final grade._

For the purposes of this assignment, we will be examining the following core R data sets and playing with some descriptive statistics:

1) nhtemp, a time series of 60 observations of the mean annual temperature in degrees Fahrenheit in New Haven, Connecticut, from 1912 to 1971, and 

2) USArrests, statistics on violent crime arrests per 100,000 residents by US state in 1973.

#Notes for R
The package for piping, dyplr, is used and will therefore need to be installed if not already present.

#other files included in repository & description

-nhtemp.R - the R file with the original coding of descriptive statistics relating to nhtemp. This file also dynamically links to USArrests.

-USArrests.R - the R file with the original coding of descriptive statistics relating to USArrests.

-Assignment1FinalOutput.rmd - a markdown file with some of the descriptive statistics from the two R files.

-Assignment1FinalOutput.pdf - PDF of the markdown file of assignment summary.
