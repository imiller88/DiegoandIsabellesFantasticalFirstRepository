This is README for the submission of the First Pair Assignment by Diego and Isabelle. We have created a GitHub repository called DiegoandIsabellesFantasticalFirstRepository that will include R source code files that access at least two core R data sets, perform basic transformations on the data, and illustrate the datas' distributions using a variety relevant of descriptive statistics. At least one file will dynamically link to another in a substantively meaningful way. Finally, another pair will make a pull request and it should be discussed and merged. Deadline 4 March, 10% of final grade.
